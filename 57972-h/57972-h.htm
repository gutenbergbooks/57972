precipitation forms. This acidity has caused people to worry about the environment; some reports show
that acid rain has affected lakes, trees, and fish populations in the Northeastern United States
and Canada. Another concern is its effect on historic buildings and monuments.</p>
<p>The booklet focuses on acid rain and its impact on our Nation&rsquo;s capital. Rain in Washington, D. C.,
has an average acidity of 4.2, about as acid as a carbonated drink and more than ten times as acid as
clean, unpolluted rain. This booklet will define acid rain, explain what effects it has on marble and
limestone buildings, and show, on a walking tour, some of the places in our Nation&rsquo;s capital
where you can see the impact of acid precipitation.</p>

<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">What is acid rain?</span></h2>
<p>The term &ldquo;acid rain&rdquo; is commonly used to mean the deposition of acidic
components in rain, snow, fog, dew, or dry particles. The more accurate
term is &ldquo;acid precipitation.&rdquo; Distilled water, which contains no carbon dioxide,
has a neutral pH of 7. Liquids with a pH less than 7 are acid, and those with
a pH greater than 7 are alkaline (or basic). &ldquo;Clean&rdquo; or unpolluted rain has a
slightly acidic pH of 5.6, because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together
to form carbonic acid, a weak acid. Around Washington, D.C., however,
the average rain pH is between 4.2 and 4.4.</p>
<p>The extra acidity in rain comes from the reaction of air pollutants, primarily
sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides, with water in the air to form strong acids
(like sulfuric and nitric acid). The main sources of these pollutants are vehicles
and industrial and power-generating plants. In Washington, the main local
sources are cars, trucks, and buses.</p>
<p>Acidity in rain is measured by collecting samples of rain and measuring its
pH. To find the distribution of rain acidity, weather conditions are monitored
and rain samples are collected at sites all over the country. The areas of
greatest acidity (lowest pH values) are located in the Northeastern United
States. This pattern of high acidity is caused by the large number of cities,
the dense population, and the concentration of power and industrial plants in
the Northeast. In addition, the prevailing wind direction brings storms and
pollution to the Northeast from the Midwest, and dust from the soil and rocks
in the Northeastern United States is less likely to neutralize acidity in the
rain.</p>

<p>When you hear or read in the media about the effects of acid rain, you are
usually told about the lakes, fish, and trees in New England and Canada.
However, we are becoming aware of an additional concern: many of our historic
buildings and monuments are located in the areas of highest acidity. In
Europe, where buildings are much older and pollution levels have been ten
times greater than in the United States, there is a growing awareness that
pollution and acid rain are accelerating the deterioration of buildings and
monuments.</p>
<p>Stone weathers (deteriorates) as part of the normal geologic cycle through
natural chemical, physical, and biological processes when it is exposed to
the environment. This weathering process, over hundreds of millions of
years, turned the Appalachian Mountains from towering peaks as high as the
Rockies to the rounded knobs we see today. Our concern is that air pollution,
particularly in urban areas, may be accelerating the normal, natural rate of
stone deterioration, so that we may prematurely lose buildings and sculptures
of historic or cultural value.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">What about buildings?</span></h2>
<p>Many buildings and monuments are made of stone, and many buildings
use stone for decorative trim. Granite is now the most widely used stone for
buildings, monuments, and bridges. Limestone is the second most used
building stone. It was widely used before Portland cement became available
in the early 19th century because of its uniform color and texture and because
it could be easily carved. Sandstone from local sources was commonly
used in the Northeastern United States, especially before 1900.
Nationwide, marble is used much less often than the other stone types, but it
has been used for many buildings and monuments of historical significance.
Because of their composition, some stones are more likely to be damaged by
acidic deposition than others. Granite is primarily composed of silicate minerals,
like feldspar and quartz, which are resistant to acid attack. Sandstone is
also primarily composed of silica and is thus resistant. A few sandstones are
less resistant because they contain a carbonate cement that dissolves readily
in weak acid. Limestone and marble are primarily composed of the mineral
calcite (calcium carbonate), which dissolves readily in weak acid; in fact,
this characteristic is often used to identify the mineral calcite. Because buildings
and monuments made of limestone and marble are more likely to be
damaged by acid precipitation, they are the main focus of this booklet.</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">How do you recognize limestone and marble?</span></h2>
<p>The main difference between limestone and marble is that limestone is a
sedimentary rock, typically composed of calcium carbonate fossils, and marble
is a metamorphic rock. Limestone forms when shells, sand, and mud are
deposited at the bottom of oceans and lakes and over time solidify into rock.
Marble forms when sedimentary limestone is heated and squeezed by natural
rock-forming processes so that the grains recrystallize. If you look
closely at a limestone, you can usually see fossil fragments (for example,
bits of shell) held together by a calcite matrix. Limestone is more porous than
marble, because there are small openings between the fossil fragments.
Marble is usually light colored and is composed of crystals of calcite locked
together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Marble may contain colored streaks
that are inclusions of non-calcite minerals.</p>

<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">How does acid precipitation affect marble and limestone buildings?</span></h2>
<p>Acid precipitation affects stone primarily in two ways: <i>dissolution</i> and <i>alteration</i>.
When sulfurous, sulfuric, and nitric acids in polluted air react with
the calcite in marble and limestone, the calcite dissolves. In exposed areas
of buildings and statues, we see roughened surfaces, removal of material,
and loss of carved details. Stone surface material may be lost all over or
only in spots that are more reactive.</p>
<p>You might expect that sheltered areas of stone buildings and monuments
would not be affected by acid precipitation. However, sheltered areas on
limestone and marble buildings and monuments show blackened crusts that
have spalled (peeled) off in some places, revealing crumbling stone beneath.
This black crust is primarily composed of gypsum, a mineral that
forms from the reaction between calcite, water, and sulfuric acid. Gypsum is
soluble in water; although it can form anywhere on carbonate stone surfaces
that are exposed to sulfur dioxide gas (SO&#8322;), it is usually washed away. It remains
only on protected surfaces that are not directly washed by the rain.
Gypsum is white, but the crystals form networks that trap particles of dirt
and pollutants, so the crust looks black. Eventually the black crusts blister
and spall off, revealing crumbling stone.</p>

<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">Where can we see the effects of acid precipitation?</span></h2>
<p>Washington&rsquo;s buildings and monuments use many different stone types.
Marble and limestone buildings are the most likely to show damage, because
they are more affected by acidic precipitation and urban pollution. As you follow
the tour described in this book, see how granite and sandstone buildings
compare with the marble and limestone in the same environment.</p>
<p>This guide will help you recognize some geologic features of buildings, in
addition to their historical and architectural aspects, wherever you travel.
However, remember one important point when examining buildings and monuments
for deterioration: stone deterioration has many causes. Although acid
precipitation and urban pollution can accelerate stone deterioration, people,
pigeons, and other organisms may also harm our stone structures. In addition,
the process of weathering has been going on since the Earth first had
an atmosphere. Although we can observe deterioration of the stone, it is hard
to determine how much of the deterioration is from acid precipitation and how
much is from other causes.</p>

<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">What are we doing about acid rain?</span></h2>
<p>Scientists from many disciplines are studying acid precipitation and its
impact. The National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP), a
Federal program involving representatives from more than a dozen Federal
agencies, has sponsored studies on how acid rain forms and how it affects
lakes, crops, forests, and materials. Because buildings and monuments cannot
adapt to changes in the environment, as plants and animals can, historic
structures may be particularly affected by acid precipitation. Scientists are
studying effective control technologies to limit the emissions from power
plants and automobiles that cause acid rain. The impact and usefulness of
regulations that would require limits on air pollution are also being studied.
Finally, scientists are examining the processes of deterioration to find effective
ways to protect and repair our historic buildings and monuments.
Agencies like the National Park Service, which are charged with protecting
and preserving our national heritage, are particularly concerned not only
about the impact of acid rain but also about making the best choices for
maintaining and preserving our historic buildings and monuments.</p>

<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">A field guide to buildings in our Nation&rsquo;s capital</span></h2>
<p>Washington, D.C., has many buildings of historic and cultural significance,
and many of them are made of marble and limestone. This self-guided tour
will point out damage to buildings and monuments in our Nation&rsquo;s capital that
may have been caused by acid precipitation. Similar effects may be found in
other cities as well.</p>
<p>Places to visit have been divided into several areas, so the trip can be
done either in segments or all in one day. A suggested tour route is described
within each area. A car provides the most efficient transport between areas,
but parking may be hard to find. The Metro subway system can easily be
used to visit all areas except the Jefferson and Lincoln Memorials. The closest
Metro stations in each area are shown on the map. You will need comfortable
walking shoes, and you may want to bring along a camera, a hand
lens (about 10&times; magnification) for observing details of minerals and weathering,
and a pair of binoculars for closer examination of inaccessible areas.</p>
<h3 id="c8">The area around the National Capitol</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>This area includes the Capitol building, the Peace Monument, the
Grant Memorial, and the Botanic Gardens. We begin the tour at the
southeast corner of the Capitol, and go clockwise around the Capitol
(along the south, west, and then north sides). We then follow a
walkway heading west, from the northeast corner of the Capitol,
to see the Peace Monument at the intersection of First Street and
Pennsylvania Avenue, NW. We continue south along First Street to the
Grant Memorial and then south again to the Botanic Gardens. Total
distance is about one kilometer, or about three-quarters of a mile.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>The Capitol Building&mdash;Site 1</h4>
<p>The Capitol was built in stages; the
cornerstone of the main building was
laid in 1793, the north wing was completed
in 1800, and the south wing
was completed in 1807. Both wings
were burned by the British in 1814.
The capitol was then rebuilt, and it
has been modified several times
throughout the years. A major program
of cleaning, replacement, and
repair was begun in the late 1980&rsquo;s.
The center building of the Capitol is
painted sandstone, but the north and
south wings, housing the Senate and
the House chambers, are marble.
Around the Capitol we will observe
various examples of dissolution and
blackened alteration, especially on
the marble balustrade that surrounds
the south, west, and north sides of
the building.</p>
<p>Beginning at the southeast corner
of the building, by using binoculars
we can see some areas of blackened
alteration in the Corinthian column
capitals. A more accessible example
is found under the overhang of the
large square ends of the marble
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
balustrade at the southeast corner of
the building. The black crust is made
of gypsum plus dirt that accumulates
in sheltered areas. No black crust is
present along the cracks between
the stones; rain water probably flows
in these areas, dissolving the gypsum
and preventing accumulation of
a crust. Not all black areas on this
baluster are gypsum; in some places
near the bushes, you can see greenish-black
moss growing on the stone.
The top surfaces of the marble
balustrade are coarse and rough, because
of dissolution between grains,
compared to areas that are protected
from running or washing water where
the black alteration crust forms.</p>

</div>
<p>Another dissolution feature of
marble is the pock-mark effect on
the square bases of the building
columns. Silicate mineral inclusions
in the marble were loosened by the
dissolution of the surrounding calcite,
causing the inclusions to fall out of
the stone. A particularly good example
of this is found on the fourth column
west from the southeast corner
of the Capitol building. The pock-mark
dissolution is also found at several
other places on the building.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>We will follow the marble balustrade
around the building, noting differences
in deterioration. Some parts
of the balustrade have obviously
been replaced, thus enabling us to
observe various stages in the stone
deterioration. The edges of the
balusters are sharp when new and
become rounded as they age.
Blackened alteration crusts have accumulated
on the sheltered sides of
the balusters and under the overhanging
top of the balustrade. In
some spots under the rail the blackened
crust has spalled off, exposing
fresh surfaces and more vulnerable
stone. Some carvings on the balustrade
corners are worn, whereas
others have blackened alteration;
this difference in weathering may be
due to local effects of wind and rain.
Along the steps leading to the terrace
on the west side of the Capitol,
gypsum has accumulated on large
areas of the wall. Gypsum can accumulate
on any surface that is not
washed by water.</p>
<p>As you walk north along the west
side of the Capitol, look at the central
part of the building. The walls here
are painted sandstone. Despite recent
restoration of the building, you
can see evidence of past stone deterioration,
including the accentuated
lines from bedding in the stone and
the pock marks where rounded inclusions
have disappeared. We will see
an example of this same sandstone
that is not painted in the buildings
near 17th Street.</p>
<p>At the northeast corner of the
Capitol building, the marble balustrade
ends in square blocks like the
ones we first examined. Here you can
see an example of preferential dissolution
where the silicate mineral inclusions
remain and the calcite around
them has been dissolved away. Also,
on the north side of this block, examine
the blackened grains on the top
surface with a hand lens. Not all of
the black material you see on stone is
gypsum; some is of biological origin,
probably algae or a fungus.</p>

<p>This memorial, dedicated in 1922,

Bronze weathers outdoors if it is not
cleaned and waxed regularly. Like
stone, bronze dissolves where it is
exposed to rainfall, developing a
green color and a pitted surface, and
it also alters in sheltered areas, with
accumulation of a blackened layer.
The most notable stone deterioration
visible here is the green stain on the
marble bases, caused by runoff from
the weathered bronze. The green
stain does not damage the marble,
but it is unattractive, and there are no
methods currently available to remove
the stain without damaging the
marble.</p>

However, the cleaning and regular
washing by rainfall have accentuated
the fossils in the stone, which dissolve
less readily than the calcite
matrix. Some of the sculpted heads

help make decisions on treatment,

gathered from the survey
will serve as a known baseline for
the condition of the stone, so that future
changes in the condition of the
buildings can be assessed. In May
1990, a part of one of the column
capitals (called a volute) broke off
and fell onto the northwest portico.
This failure raised concern about all
the volutes at the Memorial, so several
other cracked volutes were removed,
and studies are being
conducted to determine why they
cracked. Because of where and how
the volute broke, it is unlikely that
acid rain or air pollution contributed
to the failure. The broken pieces will
probably be replaced, but only when
the reason for their failure is understood,
so that an appropriate replacement
technique can be chosen.</p>

the design of the building. Except for
the features around the entablature
(the edge of the roof), there are few
sheltered areas where alteration
crusts can accumulate. With the aid of
binoculars, you can see some alteration
crusts along the underside of the
roof overhang; in these places the
marble is very badly crumbled under
the alteration crusts. Some columns
show preferential weathering or loss
of inclusions, but some of this damage
might be from graffiti removal. The
most visible dissolution feature is sugaring,
where the stone has lost its
polish and the surface now feels
rough. Visitors have affected this popular
memorial too; several of the
columns, especially the limestone
columns inside the chamber, show
darkening and rounding of edges
where visitors have touched them
over the years.</p>
<p>One interesting feature at the
Lincoln Memorial is differences in
stone condition that must come from
variations in the stone. At several
places around the outside of the
memorial, adjacent blocks of marble
show very different surface roughness.
Since the blocks of stone have
the same orientation with respect to
wind, rain, and pollution, the difference
in condition cannot be due to
exposure and must be related to basic
characteristics in the stone that
was used.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some notable examples of stone deterioration are included in this
part of our tour. We will begin this segment at the northeast corner of
17th Street and Constitution Avenue, with the Capitol Gatehouse. We
will then cross 17th Street and examine several buildings along 17th
Street as we walk north towards Pennsylvania Avenue. The total
distance is about three-fourths of a kilometer (half a mile).</p>

<h4>Capital Gatehouse&mdash;Site 7</h4>
<div class="img" id="fig40">
<img src="images/p14.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="472" />
<p class="pcap">The Capitol Gatehouse, now located at 17th Street and Constitution Avenue, is made of the
same sandstone used in the White House and the center part of the Capitol, but it was left unpainted.
Deterioration of this stone is due to the clay it contains, not to the effects of acid rain.</p>
</div>
<p>This small sandstone building was
built around 1828 at the west entrance
to the Capitol. In 1880 it was
moved (along with a twin and four
gateposts) to its present site. This
building is made of the same sandstone
that was used in the central
part of the Capitol and in the White
House. Three types of deterioration
are readily visible at the gatehouse:
spalling, pock marks, and preferential
weathering of clay layers in the
stone. This stone may be more degraded
than stone in the Capitol or
the White House, because of variations
in stone quality and maintenance
to the buildings and because
it has never been painted.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig41">
<img src="images/p14d.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="382" />
<p class="pcap">This kind of sandstone was soon found to be
a poor building stone because of its tendency
to spall. (detail on Capitol Gatehouse)</p>

<p class="pcap">The Organization of American States Building is made of marble and was dedicated in 1910.</p>
</div>
<p>This marble building was dedicated
in 1910. Two sculptures in the
front of the building show some alteration
crusts in sheltered areas and
dissolution in exposed areas. In back
of the building the marble balusters
on the patio are covered with blackened
crusts, especially on the sides
facing the garden. In many places
the crusts have blistered or spalled
off, exposing new surfaces to alteration.
In general, the patio sides of
the balusters are in much better condition
than the sides that face the
garden, perhaps because washing
of the patio has washed off the
gypsum crusts on that side of the
balusters.</p>

<p class="pcap">DAR&mdash;Constitution Hall is made of limestone and was built in the 1930&rsquo;s.</p>
</div>
<p>The main damage on this limestone
building, built in the 1930&rsquo;s, is
the blackening of the side balustrade
from algae or fungi. The stone is
porous and therefore retains moisture,
thus encouraging growth of organisms.
The limestone in this
building is quite uniform and shows
little preferential dissolution, except
in a few places. On the top of the
balustrade along C Street, for example,
some of the calcite matrix has
dissolved from around the fossil
fragments, and some holes are filled
with calcite crystals.</p>

<p>The porch area on the south side
of this marble building built in 1909 is
a good place to look at some contrasts
in marble deterioration. Parts
of the balustrade have been replaced,
as shown by differences in
color and surface roughness of the
stone. The exposed stone surface
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
along the top of the balustrade is
rougher than the surfaces in more
sheltered areas. The columns on this
porch are carved around the base, so
you can examine the effects of exposure
to rain on the carving details.
The more exposed carvings have lost
their sharp edges and definition compared
to the sheltered carvings. The
bases of the columns contain small
amounts of pyrite, which is more resistant
to weathering than is the calcite
in the marble surrounding the
pyrite. The sheltered part of the window-sill
support on the west side of
the porch shows an alteration crust, a
dull gray accumulation on the stone
surface.</p>

</div>
<p>This building of brick and sandstone,
completed in 1859, is interesting
from a stone preservation
point of view. The decorative sandstone
panels were badly deteriorated,
so in 1968 the panels were
saturated with epoxy to strengthen
them. This treatment actually accelerated
the deterioration because
when water penetrated behind the
epoxy-filled area, large portions of
the treated panels spalled off. A second
renovation attempt was therefore
necessary two years after the
first, and the present panels are cast
sandstone. A post of the original
sandstone stands at the southeast
corner of the building.</p>

<p>The next part of the tour begins at 15th Street and Pennsylvania
Avenue S. To get there, walk east along Pennsylvania Avenue, past
Blair House and between Lafayette Park and the White House.
Lafayette Park has a number of bronze statues that have been cleaned
fairly recently. The White House is built of sandstone that was painted
white; the paint was used in part to improve the durability of the stone.
After you pass the White House, you will come to the Treasury
Building. Turn right onto 15th Street and walk south, towards the
Washington Monument and the Mall. The total distance from the
Renwick to the corner of 15th and Pennsylvania is about three-fourths
of a kilometer (half a mile).</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Federal Triangle Buildings&mdash;Site 13</h4>
<p>On the east side of 15th Street,
beginning at E Street, is the
Commerce Department building,
which was constructed of limestone
in the 1930&rsquo;s. This building is part of
the Federal Triangle, a cluster of
Federal office buildings in the area
bounded by Pennsylvania Avenue,
Constitution Avenue, and 15th
Street, built primarily during the New
Deal administration of President
Franklin D. Roosevelt. Some sculptures
on the buildings were done by
participants in the WPA program.
These buildings were cleaned in the
1960&rsquo;s, probably by sandblasting.
Look for fossils in relief and alteration
crusts in some sheltered places
on the carved work. Some of the
blackening on this building is from
dirt and organic material trapped or
growing in the rough surface of the
stone.</p>

<h4>Washington Monument&mdash;Site 14</h4>
<p>This monument was begun in
1848, but it was not finished until
1885; the change in color about 150
feet up marks a change in the type of
marble used to face the monument.
Although it is made of marble, its
smooth, straight shape and the massive
blocks used in this monument
have minimized the effect of acid
precipitation. Dissolution does occur
in a few areas, but the amount of
stone material lost from dissolution is
insignificant compared to the mass
of the stone.</p>

<img src="images/p18.jpg" alt="" width="537" height="801" />
<p class="pcap">The straight shape and massive stones in the

</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Our tour ends here, but there are many more stone buildings and
monuments in Washington and in other cities that may also show the
effects of urban pollution and acid precipitation. However, as seen on
this tour, not all of the deterioration of stone buildings is caused by acid
rain. To protect our historic stone buildings and monuments, we need to
limit air pollution that contributes to acid rain deterioration, and we need
to develop effective maintenance and preservation procedures that will
not further harm the stone.</p>

(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
